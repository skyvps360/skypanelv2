SkyPanelV2 is an open-source control plane for cloud service providers offering VPS services. It packages provider provisioning, PayPal-backed wallet billing, white-label branding for the application owner, and a modern self-service portal backed by a React 18 + Vite frontend and an Express.js API.

## Feature Highlights

- **Multi-provider VPS management**: Unified interface for Linode and DigitalOcean with provider abstraction, normalized APIs, and intelligent caching. See [MULTI_PROVIDER_VPS.md](./repo-docs/MULTI_PROVIDER_VPS.md) for details.
- PaaS: A new platform experience is under development.
- **Flexible backup pricing**: Provider-specific backup options (daily vs weekly for DigitalOcean), transparent pricing with admin-configurable upcharges, and user-driven region selection. See [FLEXIBLE_BACKUP_PRICING_API.md](./repo-docs/FLEXIBLE_BACKUP_PRICING_API.md) for API documentation.
- **Provider provisioning**: Linode and DigitalOcean services orchestrate instance creation, plan catalogs, stackscript automation, and activity logging.
- **Billing & wallets**: PayPal prepaid wallets, hourly reconciliation via `BillingService`, invoices, and downloadable billing artifacts.
- **Real-time notifications**: PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY feeds a Server-Sent Events stream surfaced in the UI for activity, billing, and support updates.
- **White-label experience**: Environment-driven branding, theme toggles, and shadcn-style UI primitives lets admins whitelabel everything from brandname to even the upstream providers.
- **Secure access**: JWT auth, impersonation support, SSH WebSocket bridge for VPS consoles, and centrally managed rate limiting.
- **Team collaboration**: Multi-tenant organizations, role-based routing, and auditable activity logs across the stack.
- **Mention Of Brand Name**: Use of consistant brand name definable by `.env` secret.
- **White Label**: Mentions of upstream providers can be hidden from clients.
- **Providers**: offering the applicaiton admin to define the actual provider i.e linode/digitalocean names via the admin dashboard.
- **DESIGN**: WHEN DEVELOPING AND SPEAKING ABOUT APPLICAITON SPEAK ABOUT APPLICATION IN A  customer-facing for your cloud hosting business.
 
## Architecture Snapshot

- Frontend (`src/`): React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, TanStack Query 5, Zustand, shadcn-inspired components.
- Backend (`api/`): Express.js (ESM) with modular routes, service layer, and a dynamic config proxy wrapping environment reads.
- Database: PostgreSQL migrations in `migrations/` applied through helper scripts; activity logs trigger notifications automatically.
- Infrastructure helpers (`scripts/`): Migration runners, admin utilities, billing testers, SMTP checks, and other operational tooling.

## Repository Layout

- `api/` – Express app, middleware, services, and database helpers.
- `src/` – React SPA with routing, contexts, services, and UI components.
- `migrations/` – Versioned SQL migrations for schema and data changes.
- `scripts/` – Node utilities for migrations, admin seeding, billing, SMTP, and diagnostics.
- `public/` – Static assets served by Vite.
- `repo-docs/` – Feature documentation and API references.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand.
- **Backend**: Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Bull queues, Nodemailer, WebSockets (ssh2).
- **Integrations**: PayPal REST SDK, Linode/Akamai, DigitalOcean (optional), SMTP2GO, Docker Engine hooks, optional InfluxDB metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 9+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Redis 6+
- Optional: InfluxDB 2.x for metrics collection

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and install**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skyvps360/skypanelv2
   cd skypanelv2
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Generate encryption secret for provider API tokens:

   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-ssh-secret.js
   ```

   Update `.env` with your secrets:

   - `DATABASE_URL` – PostgreSQL connection string.
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` / `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` – PayPal REST credentials.
   - `LINODE_API_TOKEN` (required) and `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN` (optional) for provider APIs.
   
   - `COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_BRAND_NAME`, or `VITE_COMPANY_NAME` to control white-label branding.
   - `SSH_CRED_SECRET` – Auto-generated by the script above for encrypting provider API tokens.
   - `REDIS_URL`, `SMTP2GO_*`, and rate limiting values to match your environment.

   

   For a complete reference of all environment variables, see the **[Environment Variables Documentation](./repo-docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)**.

3. **Apply database migrations**

   ```bash
   node scripts/run-migration.js
   ```

   To replay a specific file:

   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-single-migration.js migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
   ```

4. **Start development servers**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Vite runs at `http://localhost:5173`.
   - Express API (with SSE, PayPal webhooks, and SSH bridge) runs at `http://localhost:3001`.

5. **Seed admin access**

   - Default admin from migrations: `admin@skypanelv2.com` / `admin123`.
   - Or create one manually:

     ```bash
     node scripts/create-test-admin.js --email you@example.com --password changeme
     ```

   Rotate admin passwords promptly in real deployments.

## PaaS Roadmap

We're preparing a new first-class PaaS experience to complement VPS.

## Useful npm Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start Vite + Nodemon concurrently.
- `npm run client:dev` / `npm run server:dev` – Run frontend or backend individually.
- `npm run kill-ports` – Free ports `3001` and `5173` before restarting dev servers.
- `npm run build` – Type-check and build API + frontend assets.
- `npm run start` – Launch production Express server and Vite preview.
- `npm run pm2:start` / `npm run pm2:reload` / `npm run pm2:stop` – Manage PM2-based deployments.
- `npm run test` / `npm run test:watch` – Run Vitest suites.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run check` – Run ESLint and TypeScript diagnostics.

### Script Utilities

#### Database & Migration Scripts
- `node scripts/generate-ssh-secret.js` – Generate and add `SSH_CRED_SECRET` to `.env` for provider token encryption.
- `node scripts/run-migration.js` – Apply pending migrations sequentially.
- `node scripts/apply-stackscript-migration.js <file>` – Execute stackscript-specific SQL helpers.
- `node scripts/test-connection.js` – Verify database connectivity.

#### Billing & Payment Scripts
- `node scripts/test-hourly-billing.js` – Dry-run the hourly billing workflow.
 

#### Communication & Admin Scripts
- `node scripts/test-smtp.js` – Send an SMTP2GO smoke test.
- `node scripts/promote-to-admin.js --email user@example.com` – Elevate an existing account.
- `node scripts/update-admin-password.js --email admin@example.com --password newpass` – Rotate admin passwords.

## Development Notes

- Express boots from `api/server.ts`, wires the SSH WebSocket bridge, and schedules `BillingService.runHourlyBilling()`.
- Database access should flow through `api/lib/database.ts` (`query`, `transaction`) to keep billing and wallet mutations atomic.
- Use `logActivity` in `api/services/activityLogger.ts` to persist auditable events and emit notifications.
- Rate limiting lives in `api/middleware/rateLimiting.ts`; reuse `smartRateLimit` or `createCustomRateLimiter` for new routes.
- Frontend API calls should go through `src/lib/api.ts` or service wrappers so environment-aware URLs and auth headers stay consistent.
- Update `.env` branding keys and restart dev servers to refresh marketing copy and theming tokens.

Additional documentation for specific features is available in the `repo-docs/` directory.

## Testing & Quality

- Vitest powers unit and integration specs (see `api/middleware/__tests__` for examples with Supertest).
- React Testing Library covers UI flows where present.
- `npm run test:watch` keeps feedback tight during development; CI runs `npm run test` + `npm run lint` + `npm run check`.

## Deployment

1. `npm run build`
2. Provide production `.env` with hardened secrets and `NODE_ENV=production`.
3. Run `npm run start` (or `npm run pm2:start`) on the target host.

Production checklist:

- Strong `JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, PayPal live credentials.
- `TRUST_PROXY` tuned to match load balancer hops.
- Redis secured (password and TLS when available).
- PostgreSQL SSL for managed providers.
- Optional InfluxDB target configured for long-term metrics.

## Troubleshooting

- **API unreachable**: Confirm the backend is running on `PORT` from `.env` and migrations completed.
- **Linode regions empty**: Validate `LINODE_API_TOKEN` and ensure provider settings are populated via the admin panel.
- **Notifications missing**: Ensure migrations `008_notifications.sql` and `009_fix_notification_filtering.sql` ran successfully.
- **PayPal checkout issues**: Verify frontend SDK loads and server credentials match sandbox or live mode.
- **SSH console fails**: Ensure JWT tokens include console permissions and the SSH bridge is reachable at `/api/vps/:id/ssh`.
