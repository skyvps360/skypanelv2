Focus on:\n\n1. **Code Smells**: Identify duplicated code, long functions/methods, complex conditionals, magic numbers, and poor naming\n2. **Design Patterns**: Suggest appropriate design patterns where applicable (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)\n3. **Best Practices**: Check for TypeScript best practices, React patterns (hooks, component composition), proper error handling, and security concerns\n4. **Readability**: Evaluate variable/function naming, code organization, comment quality, and overall clarity\n5. **Maintainability**: Assess modularity, coupling, cohesion, and testability\n6. **Performance**: Look for unnecessary re-renders, inefficient algorithms, memory leaks, and optimization opportunities\n\nFor each issue found:\n- Explain the problem clearly\n- Provide specific code examples showing the improvement\n- Explain why the change improves quality\n- Maintain existing functionality\n\nPrioritize high-impact improvements. Be constructive and specific in your recommendations.",
